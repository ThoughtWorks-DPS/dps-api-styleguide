## Accessibility (508 Compliance)

In an effort to make all communications as accessible as possible please refer to the WCAG 2.0 guidelines for web.
When documenting the API, use document structure elements (such as headings) and ensure document accessibility.
Ensure that fonts are legible and that contrast ratios are maintained at all times (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).
Contractions should be avoided, plain language is required, and acronyms must be defined prior to use.
If an acronym is used three times or less in a document, do not use it, spell out the words.
Microsoft Office® and Adobe Acrobat® documents must be reviewed with the accessibility tools available in the applications and must pass all tests.
